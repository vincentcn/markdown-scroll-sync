# AR/VR Report
* This report try to explain the definition of AR and VR
* Those concepts are very young.
* Their definitions is still very vague. 
* Just trying to better understand the meaning of those words.
* I gather here thoughts i had recently about those new realities.
  it clarifies those concepts for me.


# Difference between AR and VR
* here those difference are based on current usage of those terms. 
  As their definitions are vague, the difference 2 terms is likely to 
  become more precise as we are moving along.

### Various Fields to Consider
Here are various fields on which we can compare and classify current AR and VR 
technology. It may be a good idea to classify each existing devices.
It will helps clarify all those concepts

Here are possible fields:

* the content they are displaying 
* the technology used
  * to describe it
  * is it available now ?
  * if not yet available, how far fetch it is ?
  * it goes into the feasibility of the product
* How to interact with this reality? Joypad, depth sensors like kinect or
  leap motion. Keyboard. Issue of opaque display... You don't see your hands 
  so simple thing like topping on a keyboard is directly very hard when 
  you wear and oculus
* Is it mobile? Gear vr, Google cardboard are mobile. Oculus is not. Leap
  motion is not. Likely his to be in the future?
* How to display it. Where is the screen for the user. Is there a single
  screens?
  Or two, one for each eye. Is it see thru display. Is it more normal opaque 
  screen. Can user perceive depth
* Relation between screen position and the latency issue to fool the brain
* VR implies to fool the brain about very primal things about balance. 
  The famous latency issue. 
  The one that makes you disy, sea sick and potentially throw up. 
  Believe me, after that, you don't want to do it again...

## Content Topic
* AR and VR differs greatly when it comes to the topic of their content

**About Virtual Reality**
* VR is about transporting the user in a virtual reality
* This reality is different to the normal world surrounding the user
* the user must deeply immersed in this world. the normal
world must disapears. 

### Old notes
* Virtual reality is about an other reality. Not like the actual reality that 
  surround you. 
* Virtual reality is close to the scope of entertainment because it can 
  display any reality even the fixtuous ones. it goes from the realty 
  displayed in game. Even GtaV. 
* We can imagine how the actual movie industry could use vR to display a 
  new kind of movie
* Augmented reality is about modifying our reality.
* The current works we live in.
* It is a way more profound change. 
* AR is more about utilities. VR is more about entertainment
* What reality is displayed? What is the type  of content. Is it purely 
  virtual or is it our current reality with a little bit on top

## Interaction

### Type of inputs available
* touch screen
  * any mobile devices, phone, or tablets
* depth sensor
  * leap motion, kinect, tango
* device orientation
* device location
  * precision: gps is crap
  * using markers
* keyboard

### Product Available
* kinect
* leap motion
* various joystick: joypad, other ?
* device orientation

## Mobility
* Real important when it comes to application
* a mobile device provides more freedom
* You can use it in the street potentially
* To have wires conecting you to a computer limits your freedom
* It is especially important in AR/VR because they are about giving 
  freedom to access new spaces
* to have wireless devices make a great difference

## Do You put this one all the time or only some times with a specific purpose
* how long are they used
  * it goes to confort, weight
* it goes into privacy
  * if a personn wears them in a restaurant, people around the users got some reasonable expectations of privacy
  * when a personns wears them at work, people got other expectations of privacy
